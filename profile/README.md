## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the CraftCord Github Page!

We specialize in developing discord bots using public APIs.

Our goal is to provide a high-end navigation and exposure of APIs to Discord users.

We have Developed bots like [Pika Stats](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1092991302712438807&scope=bot&permissions=8) and [Jartex Stats](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1086628134100676628&scope=bot&permissions=8) and we plan on developing more!

To suggest other bots we should develop you can join our [Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/kJ7qmp8qsh) and contact one of the developers.
